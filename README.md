# World_Weather_Analysis
performing world weather analysis with weather map API keys and google maps and google directions API keys.

# Overview of the project:
The project analyzes different weather patterns around the globe and helps customers plan their trips based on the current weather condition.

# weather_database:
In this analysis, we have created a weather database that includes maximum temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, latitude, longitude, humidity, and current weather condition in over 700 cities worldwide from which tourists can choose different travel destinations.

# vacation_search
To do this analysis, we have taken information from the weather database and used google maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. Customers can choose a vacation destination based on the current weather condition.
